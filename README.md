# computer-vision-utils
### This repo has the utils which I think are important for any computor vision task.
#### util 1. Annotate_actual_predicted.py
We have test.csv and predicted.csv for the testing data after the model is trained and evaluation is done on the test set.
Thus to see the annotation on the test images this util plot the test.csv and predicted.csv coordinates on the test images.
The actual coordinates are ploted in blue color while the predicted in black color.
